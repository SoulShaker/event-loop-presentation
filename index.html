            Hello everyone. My name is Konstantin Golovan. And today I want to
            talk about Event Loop in JavaScript.

          <aside class="notes">
            You’ve probably heard that JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
            You may have even heard the terms Call Stack and Event Queue. Most
            people know that the Event Loop is what allows JavaScript to use
            callbacks and promises, but there’s a lot more to it. Without going
            into too much details we’ll have a high level view of how JavaScript
            code is actually executed.

            <p>
              JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".
              <br />
              This model is quite different from models in other languages like
              C and Java.

              Heap is a large mostly unstructured region of memory. Call Stack
              represents the single thread provided for JavaScript code
              execution. <br /><br />It's a data structure which records
              basically where in the program we are, if we step into a function,
              we put something on to the stack, if we return from a function, we
              pop off the top of the stack. <br /><br />Web APIs are built into
              your web browser, and are able to expose data from the browser and
              surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with
              it. For example, browser provides such APIs as DOM, XMLHttpRequest
              and timers.

          <h2>JavaScript is a single threaded programming language</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            So, JavaScript is a single threaded programming language, single
            threaded Runtime, it has a single call stack. And it can do one
            thing at a time, that's what a single thread means, the program can
            run one piece of code at a time. <br /><br />Imagine we have a
            complicated algorithm of processing images which is executed in a
            browser. When there is a function in the call stack, browser can’t
            do anything. He is stuck. He can’t render, can’t execute other
            functions. The same would happen if we wouldn’t know anything about
            asynchronous and we would try to make synchronous requests to the
            network.

          <aside class="notes">
            So how can we solve this problem? Well there are asynchronous
            callbacks, promises and other stuff. There's almost no blocking
            functions in the browser, they're all made asynchronous, which
            basically means we run some code, give it a callback, and run that
            later.

            Let’s look at the example. Try to think about what comes after what.
            So “Hi” comes first, then we run the setTimeout, but that queue's
            the console log for future so we skip on to another console.log and then five
            seconds later we log "rsschool". One should mention that 5 seconds
            timeout doesn’t mean that this callback is going to be executed
            exactly after 5 seconds. It actually means minimum delay. So how
            does this work? Let’s run the code.
          </aside>
          <div data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
				```javascript 
				console.log('Hi'); 
				setTimeout(function rsschool() {
					console.log('RSSchool'); 
				}, 5000); 
				console.log('There');
				```
			      </textarea
            >

        </section>
        <section class="event-loop-code2">
          <h2>Event Loop</h2>
          <div data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
				```javascript 
				console.log('Hi'); 
				setTimeout(function rsschool() {
					console.log('RSSchool'); 
				}, 0); 
				console.log('There');
				```
			      </textarea
            >
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            We can also set timeout to zero. But the result will be the same. The difference is that it's going to complete immediately and push it on to the queue.

          >
          <aside class="notes">
            Microtasks are usually scheduled for things that should happen
            straight after the currently executing script, such as reacting to a
            batch of actions, or to make something async without taking the
            penalty of a whole new task. The microtask queue is processed after
            callbacks as long as no other JavaScript is mid-execution, and at
            the end of each task. Any additional microtasks queued during
            microtasks are added to the end of the queue and also processed.
            Microtasks include mutation observer callbacks and promise
            callbacks.
